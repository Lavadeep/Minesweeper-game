 Minesweeper-game is a game which tests our intelligence. In our project we made a 15*15 grid. Each grid is a mine and some of the grids contain a bomb.
 The game is we should reveal every grid which is not a mine if we dug a mine which contain a bomb it will explode and we will lose.
 How the game goes is if we reveal a dug it will show the no.of bombs around it (8 surrounding bombs)
